  <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.<br>
  Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.<br>
  This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader <br>
  see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points. </p>
  <p> Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information.<br>
  A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single <br>
  long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, <br>
  character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast <br>
  two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects.<br>
  Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics.<br>
  One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
